def sort_students(student_list):
    sorted_students = sorted(student_list, key=lambda student: student.cgpa, reverse=True)
    return sorted_students
You can use this function by passing a list of student objects as input. Each student object should have attributes: name (string), roll_number (string), and cgpa (float). The function will sort the students based on their CGPA in descending order and return the sorted list.

Here's an example of how to use the function:

python
Copy code
class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, roll_number, cgpa):
        self.name = name
        self.roll_number = roll_number
        self.cgpa = cgpa

# Test with different input lists of students
students_list = [
    Student("John", "2021001", 3.9),
    Student("Jane", "2021002", 3.7),
    Student("Alice", "2021003", 3.8),
    Student("Bob", "2021004", 3.6)
]

sorted_students = sort_students(students_list)

# Print the sorted list of students
for student in sorted_students:
    print(f"Name: {student.name}, Roll Number: {student.roll_number}, CGPA: {student.cgpa}")
Output:

yaml
Copy code
Name: John, Roll Number: 2021001, CGPA: 3.9
Name: Alice, Roll Number: 2021003, CGPA: 3.8
Name: Jane, Roll Number: 2021002, CGPA: 3.7
Name: Bob, Roll Number: 2021004, CGPA: 3.6
In this example, the list of students is sorted based on their CGPA in descending order.
