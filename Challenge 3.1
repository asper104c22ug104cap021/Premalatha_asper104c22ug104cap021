def linear_search_product(products, target_product):
    indices = []
    for index, product in enumerate(products):
        if product == target_product:
            indices.append(index)
    return indices
You can use this function by passing the list of products and the target product name as arguments. It will return a list of indices where the target product appears in the original list, or an empty list if the target product is not found.

Example usage:

python
Copy code
# Sample list of products
product_list = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "apple", "grape", "apple"]

# Target product to search for
target_product = "apple"

# Call the function
result = linear_search_product(product_list, target_product)

# Print the result
print(result)  # Output: [0, 3, 5]
In this example, the target product "apple" appears at indices 0, 3, and 5 in the product_list, so the function returns the list [0, 3, 5].
